\section*{Overview and Instructions}

The purpose of this problem set is to handle a large data set of seismograms and to extract some useful scientific information about the earthquake source (and Earth structure). As you will see, much of the challenge is in representing the seismic waveforms in a sensible manner; this includes judging which seismograms are ``bad,'' that is, not representative of the ground motion. A key part of this representation is determining what bandpass to use for the seismograms for each scientific question.

\begin{itemize}
\item This problem set utilizes some of scripts in \verb+GEOTOOLS+ for analyzing sets of waveforms. See \verb+doc_startupB.pdf+ to set up \verb+GEOTOOLS+.

%---------

\item The main scripts you will use are in your \verb+seis2014+ directory:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+sumatra_modes_template.m+
\item \verb+sumatra_hf_template.m+
\item \verb+sumatra_lf_template.m+
\end{itemize}

%---------

\item Background reading:

\begin{itemize}
\item Instrument response and fourier analysis: \citet[][Ch.~6]{SteinWysession}
\item Directivity: \citet[][Section 4.3.2]{SteinWysession} 
\item Sumatra earthquake: \citep{Lay2005,Ammon2005,Park2005,Ni2005,SSteinOkal2007}
\item Modes: \citet[][Section 2.9]{SteinWysession} and \citet[][Ch.~8]{DT}. See also ``Computational details'' in Section 10.5.1 of DT.
\item PDFs of all referenced Sumatra papers can be found in one of two directories:
%
\begin{verbatim}
/home/admin/databases/SUMATRA/papers/
/home/admin/databases/SUMATRA/papers/SCIENCE_2005/
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

%---------

\item To find the index of a certain station with an array of stations names \verb+sta+, try something like this:
%
\begin{verbatim}
imatch = find(strcmp('SBA',sta)==1)
\end{verbatim}
%
Or try out the commands \verb+wkeep+ and \verb+wcut+.


%---------

\item Tips on picking stations for analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pick time series that have the highest signal-to-noise ratios.
\item In several cases there are multiple seismograms for the same station (and component), \eg at the South Pole:
%
\begin{spacing}{1.0}
\begin{verbatim}
120  BHZ_00  IU   QSPA   nm / sec
121  BHZ_10  IU   QSPA   nm / sec
122  BHZ_20  IU   QSPA   nm / sec
123  BHZ_30  IU   QSPA   nm / sec
\end{verbatim}
\end{spacing}
%
(You can see these lines in \verb+sumatra_hf_template.m+.)
You do not need more than one seismogram for each site. In general the multiple listings represent different seismometers being used or different vertical locations, like at the surface or down a deep borehole.

\item For such a big event as Sumatra, there are many seismograms that are ``clipped'' or distorted due to an erroneous response of the seismometer.

\item Having a uniform distribution (by distance, azimuth, latitude, etc) is often needed for analyses. So if you are picking a subset, be sure you have enough stations to cover the particular variation of interest.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 1 (4.0). Splitting of normal mode frequencies}

The template script is \verb+sumatra_modes_template.m+. See note \footnote{In this problem, our spectra are computed from the calibration-applied seismograms; the complete instrument response has not been deconvolved, as we did in the earlier homework. This should not impact our main findings, since we are not computing the {\em relative} amplitudes between modes within a given spectrum.}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Recall the modes spectrum that we computed for station CAN that emulated Figure~1 of \citet{Park2005}. Having done the homework on toroidal modes, you should now have a better understanding of what the modes peaks are.

Run \verb+modes_PREMobs.m+ to see the observed modes that were used in constructing PREM back in 1980 \citep{PREM}. The dispersion plot identifies the frequency range 0.2--1.0~mHz that is used in Figure~1 of \citet{Park2005}, which is a spectrum of the {\bf vertical component} of ground motion.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item List the toroidal modes, 0.2--1.0~mHz, that were observed in 1980. List them in increasing frequency.
\item List the spheroidal modes, 0.2--1.0~mHz, that were observed in 1980.
\item What toroidal and spheroidal modes are observed (or at least labeled) in Figure~1 of \citet{Park2005} but not observed in 1980?
\item What toroidal and spheroidal modes observed in 1980 are not present in Figure~1 of \citet{Park2005}?
\item What two modes are on top of each other?
\end{enumerate}

\item Run \verb+sumatra_modes_template.m+ and examine the stations that were cut from the analysis. Describe three ``errors'' in these records.

\item Browse \verb+all_sumatra_modes.pdf+ to pick a subset of at least 20 stations for this analysis. The stations should be selected based on high signal-to-noise within the frequency range 0.2 to 1.0~mHz, and, notably, the \snl{0}{2} peak.
See also ``Tips on picking stations'' in the instructions above.

\item Set \verb+iload = 0+ in \verb+sumatra_modes_template.m+, then modify \verb+ipick+ (or use \verb+wkeep.m+) and plot your selected stations.

Compute the amplitude of the \snl{0}{0} peak for all your stations. List the median value.

\item ``Stacking'' refers to summing similar functions in order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Use the function \verb+w2fstack.m+ to generate a stack of your spectra.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Include a plot of the stacked spectrum over two ranges: 0.2--10~mHz and 0.2--1.0~mHz.
\item Qualitatively, describe the meaning of this spectrum (\eg why are there spikes)?
\end{enumerate}
%
% PROBABLY NO NEED TO REMIND EVERYONE ABOUT TIDES HERE, THOUGH IT IS THE LARGEST PEAK IN THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM

\item Several peaks in the Sumatra spectrum are clearly split; the central peak is the ``degenerate'' frequency ($m=0$), and the split peaks are known as ``singlets'' ($m = -l,\ldots,l$). 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use \verb+w2fstack.m+ to generate a stack of \snl{0}{2}, and include this plot.
\item Label the peaks \snlm{0}{2}{-2}, \ldots, \snlm{0}{2}{2} on the plot.
\item Measure the frequency of the central peak, $_0f_2^0$ ($m=0$), and the spacing between peaks, $\Delta f$.
Assuming a linear model, write an expression for the singlet frequency $_0f_2^m(m)$.
\end{enumerate}

\item  Analyze \snl{0}{2} as a function of latitude. You may find it helpful to use 

Qualitatively, how does the relative sizes of the singlet peaks vary as a function of latitude?
%How does the amplitude of the degenerate peak vary with latitude.

See \citet[][Figure 3]{SSteinOkal2007} for additional background.

\item Repeat the previous problem but for epicentral distance (instead of latitude). Epicentral distance can be extracted from the \verb+GCARC+ header. What pattern might you expect to see? (Hint: think about the nodal lines for this mode.)

\item Table 5 of \citet{PREM} lists the observed frequencies of spheroidal modes; these are also read in by \verb+modes_PREMobs.m+. See if you can identify the peaks for \snl{0}{0}, $_1S_0$, and $_2S_0$ in the stacked Sumatra spectrum. What is special about these peaks and why?

%Using \verb+w2fstack.m+, select appropriate frequency limits to examine the peaks \0s0, $_1S_0$, $_2S_0$. The PREM theoretical frequencies, $f_0$, can be found in Table V of \citet{PREM}; use $\Delta f = 0.04$~mHz on either side of $f_0$ to pick the plotting limits.

See \citet[][p. 106]{SteinWysession} for background.

\end{enumerate}

%------------------------

\section*{Problem 2 (4.0). Directivity}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.0) Examine the template script \verb+sumatra_hf_template.m+ and make sure you understand how to do certain operations for plotting record sections. It would be helpful to check what each parameter in \verb+plotw_rs.m+ does (type \verb+open plotw_rs+).

\item (1.0) We will repeat the analysis of \citet{Ni2005} but using even more simplifications than they did. We will assume the following:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The Earth is flat.
\item The travel time between the fault and any station is encapsulated with the simple velocity $v = 11$~km/s. This is the mean velocity for stations between $30^\circ < \Delta < 85^\circ$ of the source, assuming Jeffrey-Bullen P travel times and arc distances (not distances along the P wave ray path).
\item All stations are ``far'' from the fault, such that the distance from the station to the starting point is approximately equal to the distance from the station to the stopping point.
\end{itemize}
%
As derived in \citet[][Section 4.3.2]{SteinWysession}, the apparent rupture time as measured on a seismogram is given by
%
\begin{equation}
T_r(\alpha) = L\left(\frac{1}{v_r} - \frac{\cos(\alpha-\alpha_0)}{v}\right)
\label{Tr}
\end{equation}
%
where $v_r$ is the rupture velocity, $v$ is the velocity of the medium (11~km/s), $L$ is the fault length, and $\alpha$ is the azimuth to the station, and $\alpha_0$ is the rupture direction. In answering the following questions, note that {\bf no numbers are needed (only algebra).}
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item What $\alpha$ will produce a minimum $T_r(\alpha)$, $T_{\rm min}$?
%What are $\alpha$ values for the minimum and maximum values of $T_r$?
\item What $\alpha$ will produce a maximum $T_r(\alpha)$, $T_{\rm max}$?
\item The range of $T_r$ is given by $T_{\rm max} - T_{\rm min}$. \\
What is the range, considering variations in $\alpha$ only?
\item What is $\overline{T}_r$, the azimuthal average of $T_r$?
\item Show that, with our assumptions, \refeq{Tr} can be written in terms of only $T_{\rm min}$, $T_{\rm max}$, $\alpha$, and $\alpha_0$.

Hint: \refEq{Tr} is an equation with 6 unknowns: $T_r$, $L$, $v_r$, $v$, $\alpha$, $\alpha_0$. Your equations for $T_{\rm min}$ and $T_{\rm max}$ give you two additional equations with two additional unknowns ($T_{\rm min}$, $T_{\rm max}$). You are asked to write an equation with 5 unknowns (including $T_r$). Therefore you start with a system of 3 equations with 8 unknowns, and you can reduce this to 1 equation with 5 unknowns.

\end{enumerate}

%--------------------

\item (1.2) Using the template script \verb+sumatra_hf_template.m+, (and referring to the earlier homework), reproduce \citet[][Figure~1d]{Ni2005}, and include a plot of your record section.

Notes:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that the epicentral distances must be $30^\circ < \Delta < 85^\circ$, so specify \\
\verb+stasub = deg2km([30 85])+ when requesting waveforms.

\item Use at least 10 stations with high-quality seismograms.

\item {\bf You do not need to compute the smoothed envelopes---the bandpassed seismograms are enough.} (Though computing the envelopes is easy to do; see previous homework solutions.) 
\end{itemize}

%--------------------

\item (0.4) Make a plot of $T_r$ vs $\alpha$ for your data \citep[see Figure~S1 of][]{Ni2005}.

(This will be very approximate, since it is difficult to measure $T_r$.)

%--------------------

\item (0.4) Using your data, estimate $T_{\rm min}$ and $T_{\rm max}$, then calculate the following quantities:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item rupture direction, $\alpha_0$
\item rupture length, $L$
\item rupture time, $\overline{T}_r$
\item rupture velocity, $v_r$
\end{enumerate}

\item (1.0)
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the template script \verb+sumatra_lf_template.m+, show that the directivity can also be inferred from the relative amplitudes of R1 and R2, the ``minor orbit'' and ``major orbit'' Rayleigh wave arrivals\footnote{See Figure 2.7-3 of \citet{SteinWysession}.}. See Figure S1 of \citet{Ammon2005} as a guide.

Note: you may find the command \verb+extract+ and \verb+max+ useful for quantifying the amplitude ratio, though quantification is not required.

\item Is your rupture direction ($\alpha_0$) different for the high-frequency P wave estimate than it is for the long-period Rayleigh wave estimate. Why might this be the case? \\
Hint: think about \refFig{fig:sumatra_chen}.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 3 (2.0). Miscellaneous}

In this problem, you will find it helpful to use an appropriate input for \verb+stasub+ so that \verb+getwaveform.m+ will return only a subset of stations/waveforms.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (1.0) Using the template script \verb+sumatra_lf_template.m+, show the maximal displacement (not velocity) of some ``near-source'' stations. See Figure S12 of \citet{Ammon2005} for reference and checking.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.4) Include plots of seismograms (or a record section) for calibration applied (\verb+iprocess=1+).
\item (0.4) Include plots of seismograms (or a record section) for instrument deconvolved (\verb+iprocess=2+).
\item (0.2) How different are the waveform shapes and amplitudes?
\item (0.0) On the basis of your results, can you infer whether the seismograms in \citet{Ammon2005} were instrument deconvolved or not?
\end{enumerate}
%
Notes:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Note: Let us assume that \citet{Ammon2005} used the label H1 to denote the E channel (nominally east) and H2 to denote the N channel (nominally north).

\item Converting to displacement is trivial (see \verb+plotw_rs.m+ or \verb+getwaveform.m+). If you use \verb+plotw_rs.m+, then you may want to output the modified (\ie filtered) \verb+w+ to analyze.

\end{itemize}

%------------

\item (0.5) 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.4) Using the template script \verb+sumatra_hf_template.m+, reproduce the azimuthal record section of P waves shown in Figure S11 of \citet{Ammon2005}. (Plot with one column, not two.) Order the seismograms starting with the direction of the rupture direction (\verb+azcen+ parameter in \verb+plotw_rs.m+).
\item (0.1) Qualitatively describe the variations in the P waves as a function of azimuth from the rupture direction.
\end{enumerate}

%------------

\item (0.5) Using the template script \verb+sumatra_hf_template.m+, filter the BHZ time series from \frange{4}{8}. I suggest using the modes-quality stations you selected in Problem 1, but it might be easier to load the entire data set and browse the stations. Recall what we saw for CAN in the earlier homework.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.3) Identify other stations (if any) that exhibit high-frequency, post-rupture signals.
\item (0.2) Is there anything systematic about the other stations? \\
Provide your interpretation of these signals.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
